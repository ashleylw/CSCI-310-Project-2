1)What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
2)What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
3)Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

ARMAN AKHBARI,
1)I determined what features should be implemented during the second sprint.
2)I researched on how to change the API of the search bar so we can search a researcher's last names instead of an artist.
3)Not having any previous knowledge in PHP is preventing me from understanding the previous code therefore I require more time to figure it out.

1)I worked on a Codecademy tutorial on PHP.
2)Today I will continue to work through the tutorial, so that I can implement appropriate adaptations in the back-end.
3)Iâ€™m worried that we will not be able to learn the appropriate expertise quickly enough to still have time to complete the implementation.
