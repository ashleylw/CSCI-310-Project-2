1) Uhh I haven't really done anything since the last scrum since the last scrum was right before I went to bed, then I had
class in the morning and lab prep in the afternoon...
2) Will work on my goals from yesterday (look for API to find papers/extract their words and how to use it, continue
through tutorials)
3) Final project for my other class is cutting into my time. Most of my free time is on the weekend but condensing
all my contributions into the last few days before a sprint deadline isn't really working
